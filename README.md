# Boolean Algebra and DeMorgan's Law 
### In the world of digital electronics, where the magic of computation happens, lies a fundamental concept that serves as the building blocks for all operations: Boolean equations. Boolean algebra deals with binary variables and logic operations. The variables take on the values of either 0 or 1, representing false and true, respectively. Boolean equations express logical relationships between these variables using operators such as AND, OR, and NOT.
